The Smart Pharmacy Management System is a C++ console application designed to streamline pharmacy operations through a robust, menu-driven interface. Developed as a collaborative project, it provides a comprehensive solution for managing medicine inventory, processing customer transactions, and maintaining personnel records. The system employs role-based access control, offering distinct functionalities for Managers and Pharmacists to ensure secure and organized workflow management.






For inventory control, the application allows users to add new medicines, edit existing stock levels, and monitor expiration dates. It features an automated "Low Stock Alert" system that notifies management when any item's quantity falls below five units, accompanied by detailed low-stock reporting. To handle transactions, the software includes a billing module that verifies stock availability in real-time, calculates totals, and applies a 10% discount for orders exceeding 300 LE.





The system is built with a focus on data integrity and persistence, utilizing C++ file handling to save and load records for medicines, bills, and user accounts from external text files. This ensures that all management data and pharmacist sales performance metrics are preserved across different sessions. By combining structured data types with a professional command-line interface, the project serves as an efficient tool for modernizing small to medium-scale pharmacy operations.
